# Formula 1

This simple app consists of a Node.js + Express backend end a React frontend.
The backend serves static images of F1 pilots and provides endpoints to the frontend.
The frontend displays the pilots on cards, where each card has an button, to simulate an overtake.

To build and run, just install the dependencies with `npm install`, then use the `npm start` command to run the backend and frontend concurrently.
