# Formula 1

This simple app consists of a Node.js + Express backend end a React frontend.
The backend serves static images of F1 pilots and provides endpoints to the frontend.
The frontend displays the pilots on cards, where each card has an button, to simulate an overtake.

To install dependencies and start the app, run the `npm run install-all-start` command.

You can also use `npm run install-all` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to start the backend and frontend concurrently.
